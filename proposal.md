# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title of my project will be "Manage your funds with an android app (Java)"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An android app that lets you deposit money, withdraw and see the transactions

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Since I am making thisapplication in Java I will be have to use Java language and importing Java scanner and creating different voids for each section such as deposit, withdrawl, checking final balance and last transaction. It will perform some basic finctions such as listing the user or account name with user Id number or account number and provide the user with several options whether to deposit money, withdraw or see the previous transaction and exit the app when done using.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable (Not applicable).

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable (Doing it all alone).

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accpomlish the whole project no matter what (I have faith in myself). 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will complete the whole project by myself. In my opinion, when I do project I don't have to rely on other people to do thier work or set up a time to meet with them, so I can proceed and do it anytime I want and how long I want. Therefore It is much easier for me to work alone rather than in group.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Again, I wish to acomplish the whole project by the first week Of December 2020 (because diamonds are made under pressure), so I would rather imagine as if the deadline is by the end of ThanksGiving break and get it done early (rather than waiting until the very last moment), and then get some feedback from you or TA to fix some errors and bugs.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I have taken C++ 2 years ago before transfering and DPR 108 (Inventing apps in appinventor). My next steps will be donwloading the Java programming just like IDLE for python. And then start learning how to get user input and store the values, sum and subtract them after the deposit or withdrawl.
